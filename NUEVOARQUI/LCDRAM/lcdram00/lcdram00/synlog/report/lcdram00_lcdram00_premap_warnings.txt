@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: BN132 :"c:\users\valery garibay\desktop\nuevoarqui\lcdram\lcdram00vhdl\contreadra00.vhdl":26:5:26:6|Removing sequential instance RA05.outFlagcd because it is equivalent to instance RA05.ENcd. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\valery garibay\desktop\nuevoarqui\lcdram\osc00vhdl\div00.vhdl":20:0:20:1|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including RA00.OS01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
