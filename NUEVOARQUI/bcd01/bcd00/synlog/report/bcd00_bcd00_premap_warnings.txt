@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"g:\bcd01\mux00.vhdl":23:7:23:10|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 7 sequential elements including U15.outBCDmux_1[6:1].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"g:\bcd01\div00.vhdl":22:5:22:6|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including U00.UD01.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
