@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\saiko\documents\escom\5 semestre\arqui de computadoras\arquitectura\generic04\generic02\div00\div0.vhdl":20:5:20:6|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including G00.U1.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
