@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"f:\alu02\acal00.vhdl":21:2:21:3|Found inferred clock acal00|clkacal which controls 10 sequential elements including aux. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
