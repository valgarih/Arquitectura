@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\jmaci\desktop\nueva carpeta (2)\div00.vhdl":20:4:20:5|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 25 sequential elements including K00.OS01.sdiv[23:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
