@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\valery garibay\documents\nuevog\alu01\subsal00.vhdl":24:1:24:2|Found inferred clock subsal00|clksubs which controls 21 sequential elements including aux. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
