@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\james\documents\escom_semestre_6\3cm2_arquitectura\project3cm2machx02\bcd01\mux00.vhd":23:7:23:10|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 7 sequential elements including U15.outBCDmux_1[6:1].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
